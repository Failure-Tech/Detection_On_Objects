This project is about using computer vision to detect license plates and find the exact number 
when held up to a camera. I use object detection and an optical character recognition algorithm
to do this. Basically, we need to run object detection by accessing the camera and having it detect 
text on objects. There is still a little more to work as I would rather have my own custom ocr 
detection algorithm but for now, this works well.
